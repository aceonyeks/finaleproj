While I achieved significant milestones, there are areas Iâ€™m focusing on improving through practice and dedication.

      <h2>What I've Learned Since Mid-Semester</h2>
      <p>
        This semester emphasized the importance of discipline and structured practice in tennis and boxing. Developing a consistent training routine has allowed me to improve my endurance and precision. For tennis, focusing on strategies for doubles matches has been enlightening, while in boxing, refining my defensive techniques has been a game-changer.
      </p>
      <p>
        One aspect that worked particularly well was dividing my training schedule to focus on specific skills. For tennis, drills like volley practice and footwork drills have helped. In boxing, shadowboxing and sparring sessions provided clarity in addressing weaknesses. This approach simplified the process and made training more effective.

        However, the journey was not without challenges. Balancing practice for tennis and boxing while managing other responsibilities was demanding. Additionally, recovering from minor injuries required adapting my routine and maintaining consistency. These experiences highlighted the importance of rest and proper technique.
